# Digital Logic Guide

To fully understand how a computer works, it is important to understand the different layers of abstractions within the computer. Here, we will discuss some of the lower layers of abstraction: Transistor Level, Logic Gates and Registers, and Logic Blocks. Furthermore, we will discuss how to represent these different types of hardware using HDL, a Hardware Description Language. Specifically, we will be using Verilog for the tutorial.
